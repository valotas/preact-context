This is an implementation of react's [new context api][rfcs]. You can read more
about it on [react's documentation][react-context-doc] page.

This package provides the `createContext` factory function that can be used
in order to create a context:

```js
import { h } from "preact";
import { createContext } from "preact-context";

const Theme = createContext("dark");
```

The returned object contains two components: a `Provider` and a `Consumer`.

## The `Consumer`

It can be used in order to consume the provided object:

```jsx
<Theme.Consumer>{theme => <p>Selected theme: {theme}</p>}</Theme.Consumer>
```

Alternatively, it can also be used with a render property:

```jsx
<Theme.Consumer render={theme => <p>Selected theme: {theme}</p>} />
```

## The `Provider`

can be used in order to update the value of a context:

```jsx
<Theme.Provider value="sunny">
```

will change "dark" to "sunny" and notify all it's consumers of the change.

# Development

This project has been written with [typescript][typescript].
